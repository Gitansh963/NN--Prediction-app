# Student Success Predictor

This is a prediction application that uses Neural Networks to predict whether a student will complete their program or drop out.

## Features

- **Student Success Prediction**: The application predicts the likelihood of a student completing their program based on various factors.
- **Neural Networks**: The prediction model is built using Neural Networks, a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the human brain.

## Technologies Used

- **Neural Networks**: The prediction model is built using Neural Networks. This allows the model to learn and improve over time, providing more accurate predictions.
- **Machine Learning**: The application uses machine learning techniques to train the prediction model.
